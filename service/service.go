/*
Our algorithm can be used to implement any deterministic replicated service with a state and some operations. The
operations are not restricted to simple reads or writes of portions of the service state; they can perform arbitrary
deterministic computations using the state and operation arguments. Clients issue requests to the replicated service to
invoke operations and block waiting for a reply. The replicated service is implemented by   replicas. Clients and
replicas are non-faulty if they follow the algorithm in Section 4 and if no attacker can forge their signature.

	Each replica i executes the operation requested by m  after committed-local(m, v, n, i)is true and iâ€™s state

reflects the sequential execution of all requests with lower sequence numbers. This ensures that all non- faulty replicas
execute requests in the same order as required to provide the safety property. After executing the requested operation,
replicas send a reply to the client. Replicas discard requests whose timestamp is lower than the timestamp in the last
reply they sent to the client to guarantee exactly-once semantics.

	We do not rely on ordered message delivery, and therefore it is possible for a replica to commit requests out

of order. This does not matter since it keeps the pre- prepare, prepare, and commit messages logged until the
corresponding request can be executed.
